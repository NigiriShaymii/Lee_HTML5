		<p> <em> Our hearts reach out to those who lost their loved ones to Covid-19. </em></p>

		<p> Covid-19 has changed our lives in every way: socially, physically, emotionally, mentally, and so forth. With the hardship and struggles, we have teamed up with multiple hotlines such as National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, National Domestic Violence Hotline, and so forth in order to help spread support. We are also aware of the misinformation, conspiracies, and other misleading advices. Information about Covid-19 will continue to be updated and we will provide you with the latest updated news. Thus, staffs will constantly be reviewed under strict rules in order to not accidentally or purposefully share wrong information. One thing that PhonePal will abide is that political conversatioons will not be involved with Covid-19 at all. We thank you for your safety and please, wash your hands and stay safe. </p>
