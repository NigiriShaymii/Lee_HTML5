		<h1> About Us </h1>
		<h2> What is PhonePal? </h2>
		<p> PhonePal is a communicative service allowing our staff to get you informed with the latest hot topics or news from weather reports to gaming. It is our duty to bring you quality information, allowing you to catch up to speed with communities, humanity, and the world. We are pleased 
		to guide you with our best staffs with any friendly conversations and guidance in support of any issues. We do not use video for any of our services in order to minimize distractions. Videos encourage multitasking, unhealthy amount of time to facial and background exposure, and onscreen stimuli. Phone calls prevent everything listed in order to make social interaction as stress-free as possible.</p>

		<h2> New Voices, New Friends </h2>
		<p> Yes, we are aware that speaking to unfamiliar voices can be nerve-wreaking. Our policies disregard any AI and bots to conversating with customers. Even so, it is already frightening to speak with a stranger but all we ask is at least little trust in us.</p>

		<p><strong> It has come to our attention that due to Covid-19, we are hiring new members to our team. Because of physical social restrictions, conversations are more likely and favorable via phone calls and we are honored to help bridge the gap of social interactions. Click below to learn more about our response to Covid-19. </strong></p>
